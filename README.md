# archives
Old projects I did growing up.

Sadly, many of these files have gotten corrupted over the years. Still others might not strictly be my doing.

If they don't explicitly say they were by me, they might be the work of my friend Travis, or else copied from
some BASIC beginner book or something.

These files are at least legible:
- EXPLODE.BAS
- SILICON.BAS
- SINEWAVE.BAS
- STROBE.BAS
- SWX_WNG.BAS
- S_CRUMB1.BAS
- cc21.bas
- kkey2.bas

The rest are mangled. If I ever find un-corrupted copies, I will upload them.
